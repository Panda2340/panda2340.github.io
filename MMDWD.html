<h2>Our Advice and tips for going on the Dark Web</h2>
<p> First and foremost, if you don’t have a reason to be on the dark web, stay off it. But if you don’t want to listen to that rule then you have come to the right place. Use our directory as you please. 


<p> SAFETY
<p> To protect your privacy when accessing the dark web, the first essential step is to install the official Tor Browser, as it is uniquely engineered for anonymity and is far more secure for this purpose than any other browser like Freenet or Brave. For an added layer of protection, you should choose between using a VPN or installing Tails. (learn how to install Tails here and or here however, you should avoid using both at the same time to prevent configuration conflicts. Ideally, you should use Tails—a live operating system that routes all traffic through Tor and leaves no trace on your hardware. If that is too complex, a reputable service like Proton VPN is a solid alternative. If you choose a VPN, always connect to it before launching Tor to ensure your ISP cannot see you are using the network. Finally, once inside the browser, manually set your security level to "Safest" to disable potentially malicious scripts and maximize your protection. Another safety tip (more just common sense) is to never use your real name, or personal email address while on the dark web. Crucially, you should also avoid maximizing your browser window; keeping it at its default size This prevents websites from determining your monitor's exact resolution. This technique, known as "fingerprinting," can be used to distinguish your device from others and potentially track your identity.
